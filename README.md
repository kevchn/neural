# Haskell Neural Networks

### Project Description
**Contributors:** Kevin Chen and Suteerth Vishnu of the University of Maryland, College Park.

**Intention:** Demonstrate that Haskell's powerful abstractions allow for the implementation of sophisticated network architectures which would be difficult to do with standard approaches (i.e Tensorflow/Pytorch).

#### Goals
- [x] Improve upon canonical MNIST example for the **neural** library developed by Lars Br√ºnjes, using convolutional neural networks.
- [x] Optimize convnet MNIST example hyperparameters
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add liquid verification

#### Reach Goals (if time permits)
- [ ] Create further examples for other datasets/architectures
- [ ] Create own addons (pooling) to increase library functionality 

#### Notes
- Examples run extremely slowly, takes a long time to figure out hyperparameters 
- Complicated architectures are nearly impossible to run for a 2016 MBP
